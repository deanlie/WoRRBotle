# WoRRBotle

**WoRRBotle** is a Shiny wordle bot. It allows you to play wordle using either a word chosen by the bot or a word you choose. It is playable as a two-person game, because the word you choose is entered like a password so if neither player looks at the other's hands while that person is typing, the chosen word is never shown. It can present a list of words which are possible choices given the guesses so far, arranged by its idea of which are more likely. That list is hidden by default

This was written just as an exercise in Shiny but holy smokes, I am learning a lot about improving Shiny interfaces, R Markdown, and open source in the course of doing it.

This uses the coolbutuseless/wordle package, which 
you can install from [GitHub](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/wordle) with:

``` r
# install.packages('remotes')
remotes::install_github('coolbutuseless/wordle')
```
